# Tech Showcase

## Overview

This exercise is designed to examine your ability to;

* Understand key requirements
* Adapt to an unfamiliar environment
* Utilise third party libraries
* Implement effective tests

## Guidelines

* Fork this repository
* Commit often
* Create a PR back to the repository once you're happy

## Tasks

* Create a basic implementation, in a framework of your choice, (or using bare PHP code)
   * Collects the [NSW government school enrolments by head count (2004-2018)](https://data.cese.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/nsw-government-school-enrolments-by-head-count)
   * Presents the above data
   * Refreshes the data if it is older than a defined period, (you can define the period)
* Implement tests to validate key aspects of the above, (_a_ test, at least)
* Add a method that allows a logged in user to view information about the dataset, (eg; when it was last downloaded, how many records, etc).
* Provide basic usage instructions so we know what you've done

## Notes

* Try to spend less than 2 hours all up
* We are not assessing your ability to turn this around quickly - we all have lives and jobs to attend to.
* When submitting the PR, commentary is appreciated.
* You may create and use a database for this process if you feel it is necessary.

## Key outputs

* A data transfer process that is robust
* A data transformation layer that isn't ugly
* A cleanly implemented rendering layer
* Tests that run
